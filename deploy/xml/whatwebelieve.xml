	<headline>What We Believe</headline>
	<copy>	At Mt. Zion, we believe in one God, revealed as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, as portrayed in the Bible. Through God's Son, Jesus Christ, we gain access to the Creator of heaven and earth through repentance, which is a turning away from our sins and being made alive through faith in Christ.

	In the waters of baptism, God accomplishes an inward work in our hearts as we enter into a covenant relationship with Him. The experience of water baptism is more than a declaration of our faith. We believe that in the waters, we experience the "death, burial, and resurrection of our old self" and rise up out of the waters as a new creation in Christ, free from the sins of our past.

	Through the infilling of the Holy Spirit, we are empowered to be a visible demonstration of Christ to the world around us. The Holy Spirit now living inside of us, directs, convicts, counsels, and intercedes on our behalf giving us added power in our Christian walk. This ongoing work of God takes us from faith to faith, as we allow the Holy Spirit to work in us. This inward work will ultimately lead us into maturity as we become true "sons of God in the earth."

	We believe that Holy Communion is a sacrament of the church instituted by Jesus Christ. Partaking of the communion elements (bread and juice) on a regular basis with an attitude of self-examination keeps us in right standing with God and protects us in our Christian walk. Holy Communion is a time where we can examine our hearts before God and allow the inward work of the Holy Spirit to purge and purify anything that may be hindering us from experiencing the best of life.

	The aforementioned statements are not a comprehensive statement of all we believe, but serve to show our belief in the fundamental truths of the Bible. </copy>

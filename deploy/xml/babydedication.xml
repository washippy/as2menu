	<copy><![CDATA[People often have a perception that dedicating children is simply a religious tradition with no real meaning. As parents, we need to know that the word of God teaches us about the importance and significance of raising a godly seed. Dedicating our children is just one step in fulfilling God’s purpose for the family.

At Mt. Zion, we believe that publicly dedicating our children is the initial step to a very serious commitment to God. Proverbs 22:6 says, <span class="ital">“Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it.”</span> A second scriptural admonition is found in Deuteronomy 6:4-7, <span class="ital">“Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is one! You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength. And these words which I command you today shall be in your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up.”</span> 

Dedicating your children enters your family into a commitment with the Lord, and the house of Mt. Zion as a local church. In turn, Mt. Zion as the local church body makes the commitment to support your family throughout the stages of life. As part of the dedication ceremony, your family is presented to the congregation in order to openly declare your commitment to the covenant. Dedication Sunday is the first Sunday of each month.]]></copy>

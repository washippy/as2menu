	<copy><![CDATA[Mt. Zion has several small groups that meet throughout the metro-Detroit area. These groups consist of 3-12 people who live in nearby geographic locations and gather together every other week or monthly for fellowship, prayer and to study God's Word.

Mt. Zion can seem overwhelming to some due to its size. The Small Group Ministry breaks down the "big church feel" and creates an opportunity for people to connect with one another and make long-lasting relationships within a small home setting. You may be new to the church and desire to acquaint yourself with others, or you might have been a member for quite some time seeking to expand your relationships. It is never too late to get involved. The groups run from September to June and no registration is necessary; you can drop-in at any time. 

Below is link to the current groups available. Simply find a group that suits your schedule and contact the designated leader. All of the leaders are trained members of Mt. Zion Church. They will gladly give you additional information pertaining to their group and directions to their home. 

If you have additional questions concerning Mt. Zion's Small Group Ministry or desire to become a small group leader, please call Mike Sanchez at 248.391.6166 or email  <A HREF="mailto:smallgroups@mtzion.org">smallgroups@mtzion.org</A>.

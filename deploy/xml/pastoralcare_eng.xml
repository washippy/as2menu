	<copy>In 2004, Mt. Zion officially launched its building campaign program for the construction of a brand new ministry complex that would be attached to the current main facility. The new facilities expansion is designed to include an expansive office center, a 400-seat theatre, and a 3,800-seat main auditorium. Additionally, Mt. Zion's international outreach began as Rick and Rosa Mu√±oz (former Hispanic Ministry Pastors) were sent as Apostles to Central America. In early 2005, they officially settled in San Salvador, El Salvador with two new Mt. Zion churches planted.</copy>

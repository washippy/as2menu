	<copy><![CDATA[At Mt. Zion, we believe church is a place to connect with people. It is a place where you can find a connection with others, even within the large congregation.  We provide many opportunities for you and your family to "get connected" to the heart of our church, our extensive church family, and areas that might be of interest to you.

One of the primary avenues of connection at Mt. Zion is through volunteering your time and talent. Building a great church requires great people like you in order to succeed. Below is a listing of available volunteer opportunities along with the department coordinators contact information. 

Our next point of connection to the ministry of Mt. Zion is through our small group ministry. Our small groups are located throughout the Metro-Detroit area and are designed to connect people on a more intimate level. Even though we are a large church, we desire for everyone, at every stage of life, to feel connected and find his or her purpose in life.

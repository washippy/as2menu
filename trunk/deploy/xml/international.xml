As a fulfillment of what was spoken to Bishop Loren Covarrubias when he graduated ministerâ€™s candidate school, we have reached out to the world with the message of the new day. Starting in El Salvador with the establishment of our apostolic outreach through Rick Munoz, we have now added a TV station in Peru. Currently, we are listening to the Lord and following His lead as we continue to reach beyond; fulfilling His commission first in Jerusalem, then Judea and Samaria, and then all of the earth.]]></copy>

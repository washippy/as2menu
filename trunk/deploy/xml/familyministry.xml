	<copy>	At Mt. Zion, we believe in developing successful families. Our family ministry supports parents with children from childbirth through the teenage years. During most service times, we have programs designed to meet the developmental and spiritual needs of your children, infant through fifth grade, with creative activities and lessons. Our youth, grades 6-12, have their own age appropriate service on Sunday and Wednesday evenings, providing a relevant word and after-service hangouts to encourage fellowship and a sense of belonging.

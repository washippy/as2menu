In November 2004, Mt. Zion Ministries in Clarkston launched Mt. Zion El Salvador by sending Rick Munoz to be an apostle to Latin America. Within the first year, a permanent church had been established in the capitol city of San Salvador. Several local churches have since joined in fellowship with Mt. Zion, with the desire to be part of this great move of God. They have seen many, many miracles and reports of amazing things happening in El Salvador and the surrounding region.]]></copy>
